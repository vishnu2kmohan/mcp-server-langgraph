# Infisical Secrets Management (Optional Dependency)
# ===================================================
#
# This file contains the Infisical Python SDK dependency for secure secrets management.
#
# INSTALLATION OPTIONS:
# ---------------------
#
# Option 1: Docker Build (RECOMMENDED - Zero Configuration)
#   → Automatically built with Rust toolchain in docker/Dockerfile
#   → No manual installation needed
#   → Works on all platforms
#   → Usage: docker compose up -d
#
# Option 2: Local Development with Pre-built Wheels
#   → Install version with available wheels (fastest)
#   → pip install infisical-python==2.3.5
#   → Compatible with x86_64 Linux, macOS, Windows
#
# Option 3: Local Development with Rust Toolchain
#   → Install Rust first:
#     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
#   → Then install: pip install -r requirements-infisical.txt
#   → Build from source (slower, but latest version)
#
# Option 4: Skip Infisical (Use Environment Variables)
#   → Application gracefully falls back to os.getenv()
#   → Set secrets in .env file or environment
#   → No Infisical dependency needed
#
# WHY RUST IS REQUIRED:
# ---------------------
# infisical-python uses PyO3 (Python-Rust bindings) for performance and security.
# Some versions lack pre-built wheels for certain platforms, requiring compilation.
#
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
# ----------------------
# Use Docker or Kubernetes deployments which handle Rust build automatically.
# See: docs/deployment/production.md
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# ----------------
# - Build errors: Ensure Rust toolchain installed and PATH configured
# - Platform incompatibility: Use Docker or pin to version 2.3.5
# - Import errors: Infisical is optional; app falls back to environment variables
#
# For detailed instructions: docs/deployment/infisical-installation.md

# Infisical Python SDK
# Pinned range: Avoid 2.3.6 (missing x86_64 wheels)
infisical-python>=2.1.7,<2.3.6
