# Trivy Ignore File
# Security findings that are documented/tracked separately

# AVD-KSV-0109: ConfigMap stores secrets
# ArgoCD ConfigMaps use field names containing "Secret" or "token" but these
# reference Kubernetes Secret resources, not store actual secrets
AVD-KSV-0109

# AVD-KSV-0014: readOnlyRootFilesystem not set
# Many containers (postgres, keycloak, redis, etc.) require writable filesystems
# to function properly. Setting readOnlyRootFilesystem=true would break them.
# These are tracked separately for security hardening evaluation
AVD-KSV-0014

# AVD-KSV-0108: Service with external IPs
# Tracked separately for network security review
