"""
Hierarchical Pattern for Multi-Level Agent Delegation

The hierarchical pattern organizes agents in a tree structure where
top-level agents can delegate to sub-agents, creating a chain of command.

Architecture:
    User Query → CEO Agent → [Manager A, Manager B]
                          ↓              ↓
                  [Worker 1, 2, 3] [Worker 4, 5, 6]

Use Cases:
    - Complex project management (CEO → Managers → Workers)
    - Enterprise workflows (Executive → Department → Team → Individual)
    - Cascading decision-making
    - Organizational hierarchies

Example:
    from mcp_server_langgraph.patterns import HierarchicalCoordinator

    hierarchy = HierarchicalCoordinator(
        ceo_agent=executive_agent,
        managers={
            "research_manager": research_mgr,
            "dev_manager": dev_mgr
        },
        workers={
            "research_manager": [researcher1, researcher2],
            "dev_manager": [developer1, developer2, developer3]
        }
    )

    result = hierarchy.invoke({"project": "Build AI feature"})
