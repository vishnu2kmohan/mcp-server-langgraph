# Coverage Trend Analysis

**Usage**: `/coverage-trend` or `/coverage-trend --days 30`

**Purpose**: Track test coverage trends over time and identify patterns

**Features** 🆕:
- Historical coverage tracking
- Trend visualization
- Module-level breakdown
- Coverage delta analysis
- Regression detection

---

## 📊 What This Command Does

Analyzes test coverage evolution over time by:

1. Running current coverage measurement
2. Reading historical coverage data
3. Computing trends and changes
4. Identifying coverage gaps
5. Generating trend visualization

---

## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Step 1: Run Current Coverage

Execute coverage measurement:

```bash
# Run combined coverage (unit + integration)
make test-coverage-combined

# This generates:
# - htmlcov-combined/index.html (HTML report)
# - coverage.xml (XML report)
# - .coverage (raw data)
```

### Step 2: Extract Coverage Metrics

Parse coverage results:

```bash
# Total coverage percentage
CURRENT_COV=$(grep -oP 'Total coverage: \K[0-9.]+' coverage.xml || \
              coverage report --format=total 2>/dev/null || \
              echo "unknown")

# Module-level coverage
coverage report --format=markdown > /tmp/coverage_by_module.md

# Or parse HTML
grep -A 5 "Total" htmlcov-combined/index.html
```

### Step 3: Load Historical Data

Read stored coverage history:

```bash
# Coverage history stored in .coverage-history/
# Format: YYYY-MM-DD,coverage_percentage,modules_covered

# Create if doesn't exist
mkdir -p .coverage-history

# Append current measurement
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d),$CURRENT_COV" >> .coverage-history/trend.csv
```

### Step 4: Calculate Trends

Analyze coverage evolution:

```bash
# Last 7 days average
tail -7 .coverage-history/trend.csv | awk -F',' '{sum+=$2; count++} END {print sum/count}'

# Last 30 days average
tail -30 .coverage-history/trend.csv | awk -F',' '{sum+=$2; count++} END {print sum/count}'

# Trend direction
# Compare last 7 days vs previous 7 days
```

### Step 5: Generate Visualization

Create ASCII trend chart:

```

## 📈 Coverage Metrics

### Overall Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Total Coverage | 69% | 80% | 🟡 On track |
| Unit Coverage | 75% | 85% | 🟡 Improving |
| Integration Coverage | 62% | 75% | 🟡 Improving |
| Combined Coverage | 69% | 80% | 🟡 On track |

### Trend Indicators

- More lines covered
- New tests added

**Stable** →:
- Coverage unchanged (±1%)
- Maintaining current level

**Declining** ↓:
- Coverage decreased
- Code added without tests
- Tests removed

### Module Categories

**High Coverage** (> 80%):
- Core modules
- Critical paths
- Well-tested features

**Medium Coverage** (60-80%):
- Most modules
- Good test coverage
- Room for improvement

**Low Coverage** (< 60%):
- New modules
- Complex/difficult to test
- Needs attention

**Untested** (0%):
- Dead code
- Generated files

## 🎯 Coverage Goals

### Project Targets

From project configuration:

```toml
[tool.coverage.report]
fail_under = 80.0        # Long-term target
precision = 1

[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
omit = [
    "*/tests/*",
    "*/examples/*",
    "*/__init__.py"
]
```

### Sprint Goals

Typical sprint coverage goals:

**Short-term** (1 sprint):
- +2-3% coverage increase
- Cover 1-2 low-coverage modules
- No coverage regressions

**Medium-term** (1 month):
- +5-10% coverage increase
- All modules > 60%
- Critical paths > 90%

**Long-term** (3 months):
- 80%+ total coverage
- All modules > 70%
- Critical paths > 95%

## 🔧 Options

### Quick Check

Just show current coverage:

```bash
coverage report --format=total
```

### Detailed Analysis

Full trend report with 30-day history:

```bash
python scripts/workflow/coverage-trend-analyzer.py --days 30 --detailed
```

### Module Focus

Analyze specific module:

```bash
coverage report --include="src/auth/*"
```

### Specialized Coverage Reports

**HTML Report Only** (fastest for browsing):
```bash
make test-coverage-html
# Opens: htmlcov/index.html
```

**XML Report Only** (for CI/coverage services):
```bash
make test-coverage-xml
# Generates: coverage.xml
```

**Terminal Report Only** (quick overview):
```bash
make test-coverage-terminal
```

**Incremental Coverage** (80-90% faster):
```bash
make test-coverage-changed
```
Only tests changed code since last run using pytest-testmon.
First run tests all files, subsequent runs only test changes.

**Fast Coverage** (unit tests only, 70-80% faster):
```bash
make test-coverage-fast
```
Parallel execution, unit tests only.

## 💡 Coverage Improvement Strategies

### Strategy 1: Target Low-Hanging Fruit

Focus on modules with:
- Low coverage (< 60%)
- High importance (critical paths)
- Easy to test (pure functions)

### Strategy 2: Test New Code First

Enforce coverage on new code:
- Pre-commit hooks check coverage delta
- PR checks require coverage maintenance
- New files must have ≥ 80% coverage

### Strategy 3: Incremental Improvement

Add 1-2% coverage per sprint:
- Sustainable pace
- Gradual improvement
- No burnout

### Strategy 4: Delete Dead Code

Remove untested, unused code:
- Improves coverage percentage
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Cleaner codebase

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No historical data

```bash
# Create coverage history tracking
mkdir -p .coverage-history
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d),$(coverage report --format=total)" \
  >> .coverage-history/trend.csv
```

### Issue: Coverage calculation fails

```bash
# Ensure tests have run with coverage
make test-coverage-combined

# Check coverage files exist
ls -la coverage.xml .coverage
```

### Issue: Trend shows unexpected changes

```bash
# Check what files changed
git diff HEAD~7 --stat src/

# Review new files
git diff HEAD~7 --name-status | grep "^A"
```
