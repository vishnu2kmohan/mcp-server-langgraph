# OpenShift Security Context Patch for PostgreSQL
# ================================================
# Configures PostgreSQL StatefulSet for OpenShift restricted-v2 SCC.
#
# PostgreSQL Alpine image runs as UID 70 (postgres user), but
# OpenShift will assign an arbitrary UID. fsGroup: 0 ensures
# the postgres data directory is accessible.
