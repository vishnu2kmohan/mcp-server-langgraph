# Transform redis-session service to ExternalName service for Memorystore Redis
#
# Replaces the base ClusterIP service (which points to in-cluster redis-session
# deployment) with an ExternalName service that uses Cloud DNS for robust failover.
#
# IMPORTANT: Configure Cloud DNS record before deploying:
#   redis-session-staging.internal -> Your Memorystore Redis IP
#
# See: DNS_SETUP.md for Cloud DNS configuration instructions
#
# Using Cloud DNS instead of hard-coded IPs enables:
# - Automatic failover (update DNS, no manifest changes needed)
# - Environment portability
# - Centralized IP management
