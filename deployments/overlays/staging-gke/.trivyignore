# Trivy Security Scan Suppressions - GKE Staging Overlay
# =============================================================================
#
# This file contains documented suppressions for false positive Trivy findings.
#
# IMPORTANT: Only suppress findings that are verified false positives.
# All suppressions must be documented with clear justification.
#
# Review periodically to ensure suppressions are still valid.

# AVD-KSV-0109: ConfigMap False Positive - LLM Token Configuration Values
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Finding: ConfigMap 'staging-mcp-server-langgraph-config' stores secrets in
#          key(s) '{"dynamic_context_max_tokens", "model_max_tokens"}'
#
# Why This is a False Positive:
#   - model_max_tokens: Numeric value for maximum LLM context size (e.g., 128000)
#   - dynamic_context_max_tokens: Numeric value for dynamic context limit (e.g., 8000)
#
# These are PUBLIC configuration values, NOT authentication tokens:
#   - They control LLM behavior (max tokens in request/response)
#   - Analogous to database connection pool size or timeout values
#   - No security risk from exposure (publicly documented in LLM provider docs)
#   - Safe to store in ConfigMap
#
# Why Trivy Flags This:
#   Trivy's heuristic flags any key/value containing substring "token" as
#   potentially sensitive, which is overly broad for this use case.
#
# Verification:
#   - Reviewed configmap-patch.yaml lines 76-77, 99-100
#   - Confirmed values are numeric configuration, not auth credentials
#   - No sensitive data present

# AVD-KSV-0108: ExternalName Service - Memorystore Redis Cloud DNS Integration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Finding: Service 'redis-session' uses type ExternalName which can be vulnerable
#          to DNS rebinding attacks
#
# Why This is a False Positive:
#   We use ExternalName + Cloud DNS to reference Google Cloud Memorystore Redis,
#   which is a managed service external to the GKE cluster.
#
# Security Mitigations:
#   1. **Private Cloud DNS Zone**: DNS zone 'staging.internal' is private with
#      VPC-only visibility. External attackers cannot modify DNS records.
#
#   2. **IAM-Protected DNS Management**: Updating Cloud DNS requires GCP IAM
#      permissions. Only authorized infrastructure team has access. All changes
#      are audit logged.
#
#   3. **Internal Network Only**: Memorystore Redis is in the same GCP project
#      VPC. Traffic never leaves Google's network. No external DNS resolution.
#
#   4. **No User-Controlled Input**: DNS name is hardcoded in manifest
#      ('redis-session-staging.staging.internal'), not constructed from user input.
#
# Operational Benefits (Why We Accept This Pattern):
#   - Zero-downtime failover: Update DNS A record, no manifest changes needed
#   - Environment portability: Same manifests work in staging and production
#   - Centralized IP management: Infrastructure team manages IPs in Cloud DNS
#   - Idiomatic Kubernetes: Uses standard Service abstraction
#
# Risk Assessment:
#   - Attack Vector: DNS rebinding via malicious DNS updates
#   - Likelihood: Very Low (requires compromised GCP IAM + VPC access)
#   - Impact: High (Redis access)
#   - Residual Risk: Acceptable (benefits outweigh risks)
#
# Verification:
#   - Reviewed redis-session-service-patch.yaml
#   - Confirmed Cloud DNS zone is private with VPC-only visibility
#   - Verified IAM controls and audit logging in place
#
# Architecture Decision:
#   See ADR-0051: Memorystore Redis ExternalName Service with Cloud DNS

# End of Suppressions
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# If you add new suppressions:
# 1. Document WHY the finding is a false positive
# 2. Reference specific files and line numbers
# 3. Add verification notes
# 4. Include date and reviewer
# 5. Update tests/meta/test_trivy_suppressions.py to validate
#
