# AVD-KSV-0014: Keycloak readOnlyRootFilesystem Exception
# ==============================================================================
# Finding: Container 'keycloak' should set securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
# Severity: HIGH
#
# Affected Component: Keycloak identity provider (keycloak-patch.yaml)
#
# Justification:
# Keycloak uses Quarkus framework requiring JIT compilation at runtime,
# which needs write access to filesystem. See deployments/base/.trivyignore
# for comprehensive security justification and compensating controls.
#
# Compensating Controls:
#   ✓ runAsNonRoot: true (UID 10000)
#   ✓ allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
#   ✓ capabilities.drop: ALL
#   ✓ emptyDir volumes for writable paths
#
# Risk Assessment: LOW (with compensating controls)
# Approved: Security Team, 2025-11-23
# Review: 2026-02-23 (quarterly)
# Owner: @platform-team
