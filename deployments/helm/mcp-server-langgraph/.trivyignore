# ==============================================================================
# AVD-KSV-0014: Containers should run with readOnlyRootFilesystem
# ==============================================================================
#
# Affected Component: Keycloak identity provider (bitnami/keycloak subchart)
#
# Justification:
# Keycloak uses the Quarkus framework which performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
# at runtime to optimize performance. JIT compilation requires write access to the
# filesystem to generate and load dynamic bytecode, making readOnlyRootFilesystem
# incompatible with Keycloak's runtime requirements.
#
# Compensating Controls:
# - runAsNonRoot: true (prevents root execution)
# - runAsUser: 10000 (non-privileged UID)
# - allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
# - capabilities.drop: ALL
# - EmptyDir volume isolation for writable paths
# - NetworkPolicy restrictions
#

# ==============================================================================
# KSV118: Default security context configured
# ==============================================================================
#
# Affected Component: OpenFGA subchart (openfga/openfga)
#
# Justification:
# The OpenFGA Helm chart uses default security contexts that are configured via
# values.yaml overrides. The upstream chart may not have explicit security context
# settings, but we configure them via values.yaml.
#
# Compensating Controls:
# - Security context overrides in values.yaml
# - Pod security policies enforced at cluster level
# - Network policies restrict access
#
# Note: This is an upstream chart limitation. Security context is configured
# via values.yaml overrides, not template modification.

# ==============================================================================
# AVD-KSV-0109: ConfigMaps should not store secrets
# ==============================================================================
#
# Affected Components:
# - Redis health-configmap.yaml (bitnami/redis subchart)
# - Redis scripts-configmap.yaml (bitnami/redis subchart)
# - PostgreSQL scripts (bitnami/postgresql subchart)
#
# Justification:
# False positive - these ConfigMaps contain health check scripts that reference
# environment variables (e.g., $REDIS_PASSWORD) in bash scripts, not actual
# hardcoded secrets. The actual secrets are stored in Kubernetes Secrets and
# injected via environment variables at runtime.
#
# Example (health-configmap.yaml):
#   redis-cli -a "$REDIS_PASSWORD" ping
#
# The $REDIS_PASSWORD is a variable reference, not a secret value.
#
# Compensating Controls:
# - Actual secrets stored in Kubernetes Secrets
# - External Secrets Operator for production
# - RBAC restricts ConfigMap access
#
# Note: This is an upstream bitnami chart pattern that is safe.
#
AVD-KSV-0109

# ==============================================================================
# AVD-KSV-01010: ConfigMap with sensitive content
# ==============================================================================
#
# Affected Components:
# - Grafana dashboards ConfigMap
# - Application ConfigMap (token limit settings)
#
# Justification:
# False positive - "token" in these contexts refers to:
# 1. LLM tokens (text chunks for language models), not auth tokens
# 2. Dashboard configuration settings, not credentials
#
# Examples:
# - model_max_tokens: "4096" (LLM context size)
# - dynamic_context_max_tokens: "2000" (context loading limit)
#
# Compensating Controls:
# - No actual secrets in ConfigMaps
# - Secrets stored in Kubernetes Secrets
#
AVD-KSV-01010

# ==============================================================================
# KSV013: Image tag ":latest" used
# ==============================================================================
#
# Affected Components:
# - Redis subchart (bitnami/redis)
# - PostgreSQL subchart (bitnami/postgresql)
#
# Justification:
# Upstream bitnami charts may use dynamic image tags that can resolve to :latest
# in certain configurations. Our production values.yaml pins specific versions.
#
# Compensating Controls:
# - Production overlays pin specific image versions
# - values-production.yaml and values-production-gke.yaml pin versions
# - Container registry policies prevent :latest in production
#
# Note: This is typically only triggered in default/dev configurations.
#
KSV013

# ==============================================================================
# KSV020/KSV021: Runs with UID/GID <= 10000
# ==============================================================================
#
# Affected Components:
# - Various subchart containers
#
# Justification:
# Upstream bitnami charts run as UID 1001 by default, which is standard practice
# for non-root containers. While UID > 10000 is preferred, UID 1001 is still
# non-root and provides adequate isolation.
#
# Compensating Controls:
# - runAsNonRoot: true enforced
# - Pod security policies at cluster level
# - Network policies restrict container access
#
KSV020
KSV021

# ==============================================================================
# KSV0125: Restrict container images to trusted registries
# ==============================================================================
#
# Affected Components:
# - Subchart images (bitnami registry)
#
# Justification:
# Bitnami images are from a trusted, well-maintained registry (docker.io/bitnami).
# They are widely used in production Kubernetes deployments and undergo security
# scanning by the Bitnami team.
#
# Compensating Controls:
# - Image digest pinning in production
# - Container registry scanning in CI/CD
# - Admission controllers can be used to restrict registries at cluster level
#
KSV0125

# ==============================================================================
# PROMETHEUS OPERATOR / MONITORING STACK
# ==============================================================================
# The kube-prometheus-stack requires elevated permissions for cluster-wide
# monitoring capabilities. These are fundamental to its operation.

# KSV041: Manage secrets
# Required for prometheus-operator to read secrets for scrape configurations,
# alertmanager configs, and TLS certificates.
# Affected: kube-state-metrics, prometheus-operator clusterroles
KSV041

# KSV045: No wildcard verb roles
# Prometheus Operator requires wildcard verbs for CRD management
# (ServiceMonitors, PodMonitors, PrometheusRules, etc.)
# Affected: prometheus-operator clusterroles
KSV045

# KSV048/KSV049: Manage Kubernetes workloads and configmaps
# Required for prometheus-operator to manage monitoring resources
# Affected: prometheus-operator clusterroles
KSV048
KSV049

# KSV056: Manage Kubernetes networking
# Required for ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor CRD management
# Affected: prometheus-operator clusterroles
KSV056

# KSV114: Webhook admission access
# Required for prometheus-operator to manage admission webhooks for PrometheusRule,
# ServiceMonitor, and PodMonitor CRD validation. The operator uses webhooks to validate
# CRD specifications before they are applied to prevent misconfiguration.
# Affected: prometheus-operator admission-webhooks clusterrole
KSV114

# KSV036: Protecting Pod service account tokens
# Prometheus/Alertmanager pods require service account tokens for
# Kubernetes API access (service discovery, node metadata)
# Affected: prometheus.yaml, alertmanager.yaml
KSV036

# ==============================================================================
# NODE EXPORTER (DaemonSet)
# ==============================================================================
# Node exporter requires host-level access to collect node metrics.
# This is fundamental to its operation as a node-level monitoring agent.

# KSV009: Access to host network
# Required to expose node metrics on host network
# Affected: prometheus-node-exporter daemonset
KSV009

# KSV010: Access to host PID
# Required to collect process metrics from the host
# Affected: prometheus-node-exporter daemonset
KSV010

# KSV023/KSV121: hostPath volumes mounted
# Required to access host filesystem for node metrics
# (/, /sys, /proc mounts for filesystem and system metrics)
# Affected: prometheus-node-exporter daemonset
KSV023
KSV121

# ==============================================================================
# SECURITY CONTEXT DEFAULTS
# ==============================================================================
# These rules flag containers that don't have explicit hardened settings.
# Upstream charts use safe defaults, and production overlays apply stricter settings.

# KSV001: Can elevate its own privileges
# Upstream charts may not explicitly set allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
# Production values.yaml overrides this setting
KSV001

# KSV003/KSV004: Default capabilities not dropped
# Upstream bitnami charts handle capability dropping via values.yaml
KSV003
KSV004

# KSV011/KSV015/KSV016/KSV018: Resource limits/requests not specified
# Resource limits are configured via values.yaml overrides in production
# Development environments intentionally omit limits for flexibility
KSV011
KSV015
KSV016
KSV018

# KSV012: Runs as root user
# Some upstream containers require root for initial setup
# Production overlays configure runAsNonRoot where possible
KSV012

# KSV014: Root file system is not read-only
# Certain applications (OpenFGA, Jaeger, Keycloak) require writable filesystems
# for caching, JIT compilation, or temporary files
# Note: AVD-KSV-0014 already covers Keycloak; this covers others
KSV014

# KSV030: Runtime/Default Seccomp profile not set
# Seccomp profiles are configured at cluster level via PodSecurityPolicies
# or via values.yaml overrides
KSV030

# KSV104: Seccomp policies disabled
# Same as KSV030 - handled at cluster level
KSV104

# KSV106: Container capabilities must only include NET_BIND_SERVICE
# Some containers require additional capabilities for operation
# Specific capabilities are documented in chart values
KSV106

# ==============================================================================
# NAMESPACE PLACEMENT
# ==============================================================================
# These rules flag resources in default or system namespaces.
# Production deployments use dedicated namespaces.

# KSV110: Workloads in the default namespace
# Development templates may default to 'default' namespace
# Production deployments specify explicit namespaces
KSV110

# no-user-pods-in-system-namespace
# kube-prometheus-stack creates services in kube-system for
# scraping kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, kube-proxy, etc.
# These are monitoring endpoints, not user workloads
no-user-pods-in-system-namespace
