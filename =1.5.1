error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─>
    The system-wide Python installation in Gentoo should be maintained
    using the system package manager (e.g. emerge).

    If the package in question is not packaged for Gentoo, please
    consider installing it inside a virtual environment, e.g.:

    python -m venv /path/to/venv
    . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
    pip install mypackage

    To exit the virtual environment, run:

    deactivate

    The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by
    re-sourcing the activate file.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
