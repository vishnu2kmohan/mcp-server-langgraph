Example: Complete Agentic Workflow with All Enhancements

Demonstrates all Anthropic best practices working together:
1. Just-in-Time Context Loading (Dynamic Context Loader)
2. Parallel Tool Execution (Performance optimization)
3. Enhanced Structured Note-Taking (LLM Extraction)
4. Context Compaction (Long-horizon tasks)
5. LLM-as-Judge Verification (Quality assurance)

This is the complete agentic loop:
  START → Load Context → Compact → Route → Execute → Verify → END

Prerequisites:
- Qdrant running (docker compose up -d qdrant)
- Redis running (docker compose up -d redis)
- LLM configured
- All feature flags enabled in .env

Microservices Architecture Best Practices:
1. Single Responsibility - Each service does one thing well
2. Decentralized Data - Each service owns its database
3. API Gateway - Centralized entry point for clients
4. Service Discovery - Dynamic service location (Consul, etcd)
5. Circuit Breakers - Prevent cascading failures
6. Observability - Distributed tracing, logging, metrics

Key Technologies:
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- Kong/Nginx for API gateway
- Prometheus for monitoring

API Gateway Pattern:
An API gateway is a single entry point for all clients. It handles:
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Load balancing
- Caching

Popular Options:
- Kong (Nginx-based, high performance)
- AWS API Gateway (managed service)
- Traefik (cloud-native, Docker integration)
- Envoy (modern, extensible)

Configuration example (Kong):
- Plugins for auth, rate limiting, cors
- Declarative config via YAML
- PostgreSQL or Cassandra for storage

Database per Service Pattern:
Each microservice maintains its own database. Benefits:
- Loose coupling between services
- Independent scaling
- Technology heterogeneity
- Fault isolation

Challenges:
- Distributed transactions (use Saga pattern)
- Data consistency (eventual consistency)
- Joins across services (API composition or CQRS)

Best Practices:
- Use event sourcing for audit trails
- Implement compensating transactions
- Monitor replication lag
- Plan for database migrations

Tools:
- Flyway/Liquibase for migrations
- Debezium for CDC (Change Data Capture)
- Kafka for event streaming

Based on your requirements, here's a recommended migration approach:

**API Gateway Selection:**
For your scale (100K requests/day), I recommend **Kong API Gateway** because:
1. High performance (Nginx-based, handles millions of requests)
2. Extensive plugin ecosystem (auth, rate limiting, monitoring)
3. Easy configuration (YAML-based)
4. PostgreSQL storage (your team knows SQL databases)

Alternative: If you need cloud-native features, consider Traefik with Docker/Kubernetes.

**Database Strategy:**
Implement the **Database per Service** pattern:
1. Each microservice owns its database (maintain isolation)
2. Start with PostgreSQL for all services (consistency, operational simplicity)
3. Later optimize specific services (e.g., Redis for sessions, MongoDB for catalog)

**Migration Approach:**
Phase 1: Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)
- Set up Kong API Gateway
- Configure routes to existing monolith
- Implement authentication/authorization

Phase 2: Extract First Service (4-6 weeks)
- Identify bounded context (e.g., user service)
- Create new microservice with own database
- Migrate data (dual-write pattern)
- Route traffic through Kong

Phase 3: Iterate (3-4 months)
- Extract additional services
- Implement Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Monitor with Prometheus/Jaeger

**Critical Considerations:**
- Data consistency: Use eventual consistency + compensating transactions
- Avoid distributed joins: Use API composition or CQRS
- Database migrations: Flyway or Liquibase
- Event streaming: Kafka for service communication
