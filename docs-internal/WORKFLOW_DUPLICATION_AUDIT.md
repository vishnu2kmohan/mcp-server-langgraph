💡 Recommendations
================================================================================

1. **Create Composite Actions** for frequently used action combinations:
   - actions/checkout (used 115 times)
   - ./.github/actions/setup-python-deps (used 29 times)
   - actions/upload-artifact (used 28 times)
   - actions/setup-python (used 27 times)
   - actions/github-script (used 19 times)

2. **Consolidate Common Setup Steps**:
   - UV setup (appears in multiple workflows)
   - Python environment setup
   - Docker setup
   - Checkout and caching patterns

3. **Consider Workflow Templates** for similar workflows:
   - Test workflows (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Deployment workflows (dev, staging, production)
   - Validation workflows (docs, configs, security)

4. **Estimated Savings**:
   - 37 duplicate sequences found
   - ~195 duplicate step definitions
   - Potential maintenance reduction: 16 composite actions
