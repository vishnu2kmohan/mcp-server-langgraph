# CodeQL Configuration for MCP Server LangGraph
#
# This configuration file customizes CodeQL analysis to reduce false positives
# while maintaining security coverage for production code.

# Created: 2025-11-28 (PR #121 - CodeQL gap analysis)
# Purpose: Suppress test-specific false positives while maintaining security coverage

name: "MCP Server LangGraph CodeQL Config"

# Paths to analyze (default is repository root)
paths:
  - src/
  - scripts/

# Paths to exclude from analysis
paths-ignore:
  # Client SDKs (auto-generated, different linting rules)
  - clients/python/
  - clients/go/
  - clients/typescript/

  # Archived scripts (intentionally deprecated)
  - scripts/archive/

  # Build artifacts and caches
  - "**/node_modules/"
  - "**/__pycache__/"
  - "**/dist/"

# Query filters to reduce false positives
# Note: CodeQL uses query suites, not individual rule IDs like Ruff/Bandit
query-filters:
  # Exclude informational/style queries that overlap with Ruff
  # These are already enforced by pre-commit hooks
  - exclude:
      tags contain: style

  # Exclude low-severity metrics queries
  - exclude:
      tags contain: metrics

  # ============================================================================
  # Intentional Security Patterns (NOT false positives, but by design)
  # ============================================================================
  # These are excluded because they represent legitimate, well-documented
  # security trade-offs with proper safeguards in place.

  # py/path-injection: generator.py validates paths against allowlist before
  # file operations. The _validate_output_path() function enforces:
  # - .py extension required
  # - System directories forbidden (/etc, /sys, /proc, /dev, /var/log, /root)
  # - Only temp dir or custom BUILDER_OUTPUT_DIR allowed
  # See: src/mcp_server_langgraph/builder/codegen/generator.py

      id: py/path-injection
      paths:
        - src/mcp_server_langgraph/builder/codegen/generator.py

  # py/weak-crypto-hashing: api_keys.py uses SHA256 for CACHE KEY derivation,
  # not for password storage. This is a keyed HMAC for O(1) cache lookup.
  # Actual API key verification uses bcrypt via verify_api_key().
  # See: src/mcp_server_langgraph/auth/api_keys.py

      id: py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing
      paths:
        - src/mcp_server_langgraph/auth/api_keys.py

  # py/request-without-cert-validation: setup_keycloak.py is a LOCAL
  # DEVELOPMENT script with conditional SSL verification controlled by:
  # - --insecure CLI flag (requires explicit opt-in)
  # - DEV_MODE environment variable
  # Production deployments use proper TLS certificates.
  # See: scripts/setup/setup_keycloak.py (should_verify_ssl function)

# Queries to run (use default security-and-quality suite)
queries:
  - uses: security-and-quality

# Additional packs for enhanced detection (optional)
# packs:
#   - codeql/python-queries

# Trap caching configuration for faster incremental analysis
# (handled automatically by GitHub Actions)

# Threat models: Consider all data sources as potentially tainted
# This is the default for security-and-quality queries
