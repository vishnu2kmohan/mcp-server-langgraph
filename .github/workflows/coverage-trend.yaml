name: Coverage Trend Tracking

# ==============================================================================
# Coverage Trend Tracking - Test Coverage Monitoring
# ==============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   Track test coverage trends over time and alert on significant drops.
#   Maintains historical coverage data for trend analysis.
#
# Triggers:
#   - After CI workflow completes on main (via workflow_run) - reuses coverage
#   - Pushes to develop branch (runs own tests)
#   - Pull requests to main (runs own tests for PR comments)
#   - Manual workflow dispatch
#
# OPTIMIZATION (2025-12-01): For main branch, consume coverage artifacts from
# CI workflow instead of running tests again. PRs still run tests for comments.
#
# Features:
#   - Tracks coverage percentage in CSV history (.coverage-history/)
#   - Alerts if coverage drops >5% from previous run
#   - Posts coverage reports on PRs
#   - Uses extracted script: scripts/ci/track-coverage.py
#   - Retains coverage history for 90 days
#
# Alert Thresholds:
#   - 🔴 Significant decrease: >5% drop (fails workflow)
#   - 🟡 Decrease: 1-5% drop (warning only)
#   - 🟢 Increase: >1% improvement
#   - ➡️  No change: -1% to +1%
#
# History:
#   - 2025-12-01: Use workflow_run to consume CI coverage artifacts (DRY)
#   - 2025-10-20: Extracted inline Python to scripts/ci/track-coverage.py
#   - 2025-10-20: Migrated to composite action for Python setup
#
