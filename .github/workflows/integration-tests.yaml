# ==============================================================================
# Integration Testing Workflow
# ==============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Run integration tests that validate infrastructure interactions
#   using isolated test infrastructure (docker-compose.test.yml)
#
# WHEN TO RUN:
#   - On pull requests to main/develop
#   - On push to main/develop
#   - Manual workflow dispatch
#
# TEST INFRASTRUCTURE:
#   - Isolated services on offset ports (9000+ range)
#   - PostgreSQL (9432), Redis (9379, 9380), OpenFGA (9080), Keycloak (9082), Qdrant (9333)
#   - Ephemeral storage (tmpfs) for speed
#   - No conflicts with development environment
#
# PARALLELIZATION:
#   - Uses pytest-split for 4x parallelization
#   - Matrix strategy with 4 groups for faster execution
#
# ==============================================================================
