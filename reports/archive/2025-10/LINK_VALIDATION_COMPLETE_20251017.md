## Recommendations

### Compliance Documentation
- Create placeholder compliance docs or remove broken links
- Files: `docs/compliance/gdpr.md`, `docs/compliance/hipaa.md`, `docs/compliance/soc2.md`

### Reference Documentation
- Create missing reference files or update links to existing integration docs
- Consider consolidating into `integrations/` or `reference/` directories

### Format Mismatches
- Update links to use correct file extensions (.md vs .mdx)
- Consider converting .md files to .mdx for consistency
