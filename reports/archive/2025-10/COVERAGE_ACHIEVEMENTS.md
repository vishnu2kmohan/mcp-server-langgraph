**Missing Coverage:**
- Lines 151-218: Fallback model retry logic
- Lines 176-218: Async invoke with fallback
- Lines 254-282: Error handling for rate limits

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
def test_llm_factory_fallback_on_primary_failure():
    """Test fallback to secondary model when primary fails."""

def test_llm_factory_all_fallbacks_exhausted():
    """Test RuntimeError when all models fail."""

**File:** `src/mcp_server_langgraph/llm/pydantic_agent.py`

**Missing Coverage:**
- Lines 133-163: Streaming response generation
- Lines 176-213: Streaming with validation
- Lines 225-234: Error recovery in streaming

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
async def test_pydantic_streaming_response():
    """Test streaming with chunk-by-chunk validation."""

async def test_pydantic_streaming_error_recovery():
    """Test error handling during stream."""
```

### Priority 3: Agent Pydantic AI Integration (72% → 85%)
**File:** `src/mcp_server_langgraph/core/agent.py`

**Missing Coverage:**

- Lines 80-109: Error handling for invalid responses
- Lines 137-167: Streaming response generation

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
def test_agent_routing_fallback_to_keyword():
    """Test fallback when Pydantic AI unavailable."""

def test_agent_invalid_llm_response_handling():
    """Test graceful handling of malformed LLM output."""
```

### Priority 4: LangSmith Observability (54% → 80%)
**File:** `src/mcp_server_langgraph/observability/langsmith.py`

**Missing Coverage:**
- Lines 52-69: LangSmith trace creation
- Lines 83-95: Span context management
- Lines 115-118: Trace export

**Recommended Tests:**
```python
