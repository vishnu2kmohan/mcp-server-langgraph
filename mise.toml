# mise.toml - Developer toolchain management
#
# This file ensures all developers have the same tool versions installed,
# matching what CI uses. This eliminates "works on my machine" issues.
#
# INSTALLATION:
#   curl https://mise.run | sh   # Install mise
#   mise install                  # Install all tools defined here
#
# USAGE:
#   mise which helm              # Shows which helm binary is active
#   mise doctor                  # Check for tool issues
#   mise outdated                # Check for newer versions
#
# WHY THESE TOOLS ARE REQUIRED:
#   - helm: Validates Helm chart syntax (deployments/helm/)
#   - kubectl: Validates Kustomize overlays (deployments/kubernetes/)
#   - trivy: Security scans on Kubernetes manifests
#   - actionlint: Validates GitHub Actions workflow syntax
#   - node: Required for Mintlify docs validation
#
# If you're seeing hook failures about missing tools, run:
#   mise install
#
# Reference: Pre-commit/Pre-push Hook & CI Pipeline Remediation Plan (P0-3)

# Let uv manage Python virtual environments (mise handles tool versioning)
# This enables mise to automatically detect and activate uv-managed venvs

[env]
# Add local bin directories to PATH for project-local tools
_.path = ["./node_modules/.bin", "./.bin"]
