### Overview

MCP Server with LangGraph uses **OpenFGA** for fine-grained, relationship-based authorization (Google Zanzibar model). This enables you to define complex permissions like "who can access what" with precision.

<Info>
**OpenFGA** provides the same authorization model used by Google, Airbnb, and GitHub for billions of authorization decisions per day.

### Key Concepts

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Users" icon="user">
    Entities that perform actions (users, service accounts)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Objects" icon="cube">
    Resources being accessed (tools, documents, organizations)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relations" icon="link">
    Relationships between users and objects (owner, viewer, executor)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Authorization Model

The default model supports:

```yaml
## Users can be:
- Owners (full access)
- Admins (manage permissions)
- Members (standard access)
- Executors (can use specific tools)
- Viewers (read-only)

## Objects include:
- Tools (agent tools like chat, search)
- Organizations (multi-tenant support)
- Documents (context resources)
```
### Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy OpenFGA">
    ```bash
    # Docker Compose (development)
    docker compose up -d openfga postgres

    # Kubernetes (production)
    kubectl apply -f deployments/kubernetes/base/openfga-deployment.yaml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Authorization Model">
    ```bash
    python scripts/setup/setup_openfga.py
    ```
    This creates:
    - OpenFGA store
    - Authorization model with types and relations
    - Default permissions for development users

    **Save the output**:
    ```bash
    OPENFGA_STORE_ID=01HXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    OPENFGA_MODEL_ID=01HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment">
    ```bash
    # .env or Kubernetes ConfigMap
    OPENFGA_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    OPENFGA_STORE_ID=01HXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    OPENFGA_MODEL_ID=01HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Authorization">
    ```python
    from mcp_server_langgraph.auth.openfga import OpenFGAClient

    client = OpenFGAClient()

    # Check permission
    allowed = await client.check_permission(
        user="user:alice",
        relation="executor",
        object="tool:chat"
    )
    print(f"Alice can execute chat tool: {allowed}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Authorization Model

#### Default Model Structure

```typescript
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type organization
  relations
    define admin: [user]
    define member: [user] or admin
    define viewer: [user] or member

type tool
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define executor: [user, organization#member]
    define viewer: [user, organization#member]

type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user]
    define viewer: [user] or editor
```

#### Relationship Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="User → Tool">
    Grant user access to specific tools:

    ```python
    # Alice can execute the chat tool
    await client.write_tuples([{
        "user": "user:alice",
        "relation": "executor",
        "object": "tool:chat"
    }])

    # Bob can only view the search tool
    await client.write_tuples([{
        "user": "user:bob",
        "relation": "viewer",
        "object": "tool:search"
    }])
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="User → Organization">
    Organization membership and roles:

    ```python
    # Alice is admin of organization:acme
    await client.write_tuples([{
        "user": "user:alice",
        "relation": "admin",
        "object": "organization:acme"
    }])

    # Bob is member of organization:acme
    await client.write_tuples([{
        "user": "user:bob",
        "relation": "member",
        "object": "organization:acme"
    }])
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Organization → Tool">
    Grant organization-wide access:

    ```python
    # All acme members can execute chat
    await client.write_tuples([{
        "user": "organization:acme#member",
        "relation": "executor",
        "object": "tool:chat"
    }])

    # Now both alice and bob can use chat!
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Common Patterns

#### Multi-Tenancy

Isolate resources by organization:

```python
## Organization setup
await client.write_tuples([
    # Alice owns org
    {"user": "user:alice", "relation": "admin", "object": "organization:acme"},
    # Tool belongs to org
    {"user": "organization:acme#member", "relation": "executor", "object": "tool:chat"},
])

## Check: Does alice have access?
allowed = await client.check_permission(
    user="user:alice",
    relation="executor",
    object="tool:chat"
)
## Returns: True (alice is admin → member → can execute)
```
#### Hierarchical Permissions

Admins inherit all member permissions:

```python
## Model defines: member or admin can execute
## So admins automatically get member permissions

## Alice is admin
await client.write_tuples([{
    "user": "user:alice",
    "relation": "admin",
    "object": "organization:acme"
}])

## Check member permission
allowed = await client.check_permission(
    user="user:alice",
    relation="member",
    object="organization:acme"
)
## Returns: True (admin implies member)
```
#### Document Access Control

Fine-grained document permissions:

```python
## Document ownership
await client.write_tuples([{
    "user": "user:alice",
    "relation": "owner",
    "object": "document:report-q4"
}])

## Share with editor
await client.write_tuples([{
    "user": "user:bob",
    "relation": "editor",
    "object": "document:report-q4"
}])

## Share with viewer
await client.write_tuples([{
    "user": "user:charlie",
    "relation": "viewer",
    "object": "document:report-q4"
}])
```
### Keycloak Integration 🆕

**NEW in v2.1.0**: Automatic role synchronization from Keycloak to OpenFGA.

#### Automatic Sync

When users authenticate via Keycloak, their roles and groups are synced to OpenFGA:

```python
from mcp_server_langgraph.auth.keycloak import sync_user_to_openfga

## Authenticate user
user_info = await keycloak.authenticate(username, password)

## Sync roles to OpenFGA
await sync_user_to_openfga(
    user_id=user_info['sub'],
    username=user_info['preferred_username'],
    roles=user_info['roles'],
    groups=user_info['groups']
)
```

#### Role Mapping

Configure role mapping in `config/role_mappings.yaml`:

```yaml
simple_mappings:
  # Keycloak role → OpenFGA relation
  admin: admin
  user: member
  viewer: viewer

group_mappings:
  # Keycloak group pattern → relation
  - pattern: "/admins"
    relation: admin
  - pattern: "/users/.*"
    relation: member

conditional_mappings:
  # Grant based on user attributes
  - condition:
      attribute: email_verified
      operator: ==
      value: true
    relation: member
```
See the [Keycloak SSO Guide](/guides/keycloak-sso) for details.

### API Operations

#### Check Permission

```python
## Check if user can perform action
allowed = await client.check_permission(
    user="user:alice",
    relation="executor",
    object="tool:chat"
)

if allowed:
    # Execute tool
    result = await agent.execute("chat", query)
else:
    raise PermissionError("Access denied")
```

#### Grant Permission

```python
## Single tuple
await client.write_tuples([{
    "user": "user:alice",
    "relation": "executor",
    "object": "tool:search"
}])

## Multiple tuples (atomic)
await client.write_tuples([
    {"user": "user:alice", "relation": "admin", "object": "organization:acme"},
    {"user": "user:bob", "relation": "member", "object": "organization:acme"},
    {"user": "organization:acme#member", "relation": "executor", "object": "tool:chat"},
])
```
#### Revoke Permission

```python
## Delete specific tuple
await client.delete_tuples([{
    "user": "user:bob",
    "relation": "executor",
    "object": "tool:chat"
}])

## Revoke all user permissions for an object
tuples = await client.read_tuples(object="tool:chat")
await client.delete_tuples([t for t in tuples if t['user'] == 'user:bob'])
```

#### List User Permissions

```python
## What can user access?
objects = await client.list_objects(
    user="user:alice",
    relation="executor",
    object_type="tool"
)
print(f"Alice can execute: {objects}")
## Output: ['tool:chat', 'tool:search']

## Who can access this object?
users = await client.list_users(
    relation="executor",
    object="tool:chat"
)
print(f"Can execute chat: {users}")
```
### Monitoring & Debugging

#### Enable Authorization Logging

```bash
## .env
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

## Kubernetes
kubectl set env deployment/mcp-server-langgraph LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

#### View Authorization Decisions

Check application logs for authorization events:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "event": "authorization_check",
  "user": "user:alice",
  "relation": "executor",
  "object": "tool:chat",
  "allowed": true,
  "latency_ms": 15
}
```
#### OpenFGA Metrics

Monitor authorization performance:

```promql
## Authorization check rate
rate(openfga_check_total[5m])

## Authorization latency (p95)
histogram_quantile(0.95, openfga_check_duration_seconds_bucket)

## Authorization failures
rate(openfga_check_total{allowed="false"}[5m])
```
### Production Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use PostgreSQL Backend" icon="database">
    **Never use in-memory store in production!**

    ```yaml
    # OpenFGA with PostgreSQL
    openfga:
      datastore:
        engine: postgres
        uri: "postgres://openfga:password@postgres:5432/openfga?sslmode=require"
    ```
    Deploy PostgreSQL with:
    - Replication for high availability
    - Regular backups
    - SSL/TLS encryption
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Stores per Environment" icon="layer-group">
    Use different stores for dev/staging/production:

    ```bash
    # Development
    OPENFGA_STORE_ID=01HDEV...

    # Staging
    OPENFGA_STORE_ID=01HSTG...

    # Production
    OPENFGA_STORE_ID=01HPRD...
    ```
    Prevents accidental permission changes across environments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Audit Logging" icon="file-lines">
    Track all authorization changes:

    ```yaml
    openfga:
      log:
        level: info
        format: json
      audit:
        enabled: true
        backend: postgres  # Store audit logs
    ```
    Monitor for:
    - Unexpected permission grants
    - Failed authorization attempts
    - Permission revocations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implement Fail-Safe Mode" icon="shield-halved">
    Configure failure behavior:

    ```bash
    # Fail-open (allow on error) - Development only!
    FF_OPENFGA_STRICT_MODE=false

    # Fail-closed (deny on error) - Production
    FF_OPENFGA_STRICT_MODE=true
    ```
    In production, **always fail-closed** to prevent unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache Authorization Decisions" icon="bolt">
    Reduce latency with caching:

    ```python
    # Built-in caching (in-memory, 5 minutes)
    client = OpenFGAClient(cache_ttl=300)

    # Or use Redis for distributed cache
    client = OpenFGAClient(
        cache_backend="redis",
        cache_ttl=300
    )
    ```
    Balance security (fresh decisions) vs performance (cached).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Permission Audits" icon="clipboard-check">
    Periodically review permissions:

    ```python
    # Export all tuples
    all_tuples = await client.read_tuples()

    # Audit report
    for tuple in all_tuples:
        print(f"{tuple['user']} → {tuple['relation']} → {tuple['object']}")

    # Look for:
    # - Orphaned permissions (deleted users)
    # - Over-privileged users
    # - Unused permissions
    ```
    Run monthly or after major changes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection refused to OpenFGA">
    ```bash
    # Check OpenFGA status
    docker compose ps openfga
    kubectl get pods -l app=openfga

    # Test connectivity
    curl http://localhost:8080/healthz

    # Check logs
    docker compose logs openfga
    kubectl logs -l app=openfga
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authorization always fails">
    **Check**:
    1. Store ID and Model ID are correct
    2. Tuples exist: `python examples/openfga_usage.py`
    3. User ID format matches (e.g., `user:alice` not `alice`)
    4. Relation exists in model
    5. Object type matches model

    ```python
    # Debug: List all tuples
    tuples = await client.read_tuples()
    for t in tuples:
        print(t)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow authorization checks">
    **Solutions**:
    - Enable caching
    - Use PostgreSQL (not in-memory)
    - Simplify authorization model
    - Add database indexes
    - Monitor query patterns

    ```bash
    # Check latency
    curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=openfga_check_duration_seconds
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Store or model not found">
    **Re-initialize**:
    ```bash
    # Delete old store (if needed)
    # Create new store
    python scripts/setup/setup_openfga.py

    # Update environment with new IDs
    # OPENFGA_STORE_ID=...
    # OPENFGA_MODEL_ID=...

    # Restart service
    docker compose restart agent
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
