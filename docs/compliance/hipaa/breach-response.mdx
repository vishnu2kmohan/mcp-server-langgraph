## Breach Response Procedure

### Incident Response Plan

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Detection and Containment (< 1 hour)">
    **Immediate Actions:**

    1. **Detect**: Automated alert or manual discovery
    2. **Isolate**: Quarantine affected systems immediately
    3. **Preserve Evidence**: Take snapshots, preserve logs
    4. **Notify**: Alert HIPAA Security Officer

    **Technical Response:**
    ```bash
    # Isolate compromised pod
    kubectl cordon node-123
    kubectl drain node-123 --ignore-daemonsets

    # Preserve evidence
    kubectl logs pod-123 > incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
    kubectl exec pod-123 -- tar czf /tmp/forensics.tar.gz /var/log /app

    # Revoke compromised credentials
    kubectl delete secret compromised-secret
    ```

    **Documentation**: Create incident ticket in `incidents/INC-YYYYMMDD-001`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Assessment (< 24 hours)">
    **Determine Breach Scope:**

    - Number of individuals affected
    - Types of PHI involved (SSN, diagnosis, etc.)
    - When breach occurred
    - How breach occurred
    - Who had unauthorized access

    **Query Audit Logs:**
    ```sql
    -- Find all PHI accessed by unauthorized user
    SELECT
      resource->>'patient_id' as patient_id,
      resource->>'type' as phi_type,
      timestamp
    FROM audit_logs
    WHERE user->>'id' = 'compromised_user_id'
      AND timestamp BETWEEN 'breach_start' AND 'breach_end'
      AND event_type IN ('phi_read', 'phi_export');
    ```

    **Risk Assessment**: Determine if breach notification required
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Notification (< 60 days)">
    **Notification Requirements (if ≥500 individuals affected):**

    - **Individuals**: Written notification within 60 days
    - **HHS**: Notification within 60 days
    - **Media**: Notification if in same state/jurisdiction

    **Notification Content Must Include:**
    - Description of what happened
    - Types of PHI involved
    - Steps individuals should take
    - What organization is doing
    - Contact information for questions

    **Template**: Use `docs/compliance/breach-notification-template.md`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Remediation and Prevention">
    **Root Cause Analysis:**

    - Identify how breach occurred
    - Document vulnerabilities exploited
    - Assess control failures

    **Corrective Actions:**

    - Patch vulnerabilities
    - Update access controls
    - Enhance monitoring
    - Additional training
    - Policy updates

    **Documentation**: Create post-incident report
  </Accordion>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is MCP Server HIPAA-certified?">
    **No**. There is no official "HIPAA certification." HIPAA compliance is achieved by:

    1. **Implementing technical safeguards** (MCP Server provides these)
    2. **Establishing administrative controls** (your organization's responsibility)
    3. **Maintaining physical security** (your data center / cloud provider)
    4. **Obtaining BAAs** (your legal/procurement responsibility)

    **MCP Server is HIPAA-ready**: We provide the technical foundation, but full compliance requires your organization's policies, procedures, and BAAs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which LLM providers can I use for PHI?">
    **Safe for PHI (with BAA):**
    - ✅ Anthropic Claude (Enterprise plan with BAA)
    - ✅ Google Gemini via Vertex AI (covered under GCP BAA)
    - ✅ AWS Bedrock models (verify specific model coverage in BAA)

    **NOT safe for PHI:**
    - ❌ OpenAI (no BAA available)
    - ❌ Ollama/local models (unless you have proper controls)

    **Recommendation**: Use Google Gemini via Vertex AI for HIPAA deployments (covered under GCP BAA, cost-effective).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the minimum retention period for audit logs?">
    **HIPAA Requirement**: 7 years from date of creation or last effective date

    **MCP Server Default**: 2,555 days (7 years) configured in `audit.yaml`

    **Storage Recommendation**: Use encrypted S3/GCS with lifecycle policies for cost-effective long-term storage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to encrypt PHI at the application level?">
    **Not required, but strongly recommended.**

    **HIPAA Addressable**: Encryption at rest is "addressable" (not mandatory if justified)

    **Best Practice**: Use both database encryption AND application-level encryption for defense in depth:
    - Database encryption protects against storage layer breaches
    - Application encryption protects against database compromises

    **MCP Server**: Provides application-level encryption utilities in `src/encryption/`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I have a breach?">
    **Required Actions:**

    1. **Contain** the breach immediately (< 1 hour)
    2. **Assess** scope and risk (< 24 hours)
    3. **Notify** affected individuals (< 60 days if ≥500 people)
    4. **Report** to HHS (< 60 days if ≥500 people)
    5. **Remediate** vulnerabilities
    6. **Document** everything

    **Penalties**: $100 to $50,000 per violation (up to $1.5M per year)

    **Best Defense**: Prevention through proper controls and regular audits
