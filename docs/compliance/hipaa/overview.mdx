## HIPAA Readiness Overview

MCP Server with LangGraph provides the **technical foundation** for HIPAA compliance, but achieving full compliance requires:

1. **Technical Safeguards** (Covered in this guide)
2. **Administrative Safeguards** (Policies, training, risk assessment)
3. **Physical Safeguards** (Data center security, device management)
4. **Business Associate Agreements** (BAAs with vendors)
5. **Breach Notification Procedures**

**Status**: MCP Server is **HIPAA-ready** (technical controls in place). You must implement administrative and physical safeguards based on your organization's requirements.
