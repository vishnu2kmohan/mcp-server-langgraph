## GDPR Readiness Overview

MCP Server with LangGraph provides the **technical foundation** for GDPR compliance, but achieving full compliance requires:

1. **Lawful Basis for Processing** (Consent, Contract, Legal Obligation, etc.)
2. **Data Protection Principles** (Purpose limitation, data minimization, etc.)
3. **Data Subject Rights** (Access, rectification, erasure, portability, etc.)
4. **Technical and Organizational Measures** (Encryption, pseudonymization, etc.)
5. **Data Protection Impact Assessment** (DPIA) for high-risk processing
6. **Data Processing Agreements** (DPAs) with processors
7. **Breach Notification Procedures** (72-hour notification requirement)

**Status**: MCP Server is **GDPR-ready** (technical controls in place). You must implement organizational measures based on your specific processing activities.
