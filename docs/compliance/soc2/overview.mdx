**Audit Disclaimer**: This guide provides technical control implementation guidance but is not a substitute for professional audit services. SOC 2 Type II compliance requires:
- Independent auditor assessment (CPA firm)

## SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

SOC 2 is based on five **Trust Service Criteria** (TSC):

| Criterion | Focus | Required for |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Security (CC)** | Protection against unauthorized access | All SOC 2 audits |
| **Availability (A)** | System uptime and accessibility | Type II audits |
| **Processing Integrity (PI)** | Complete, valid, accurate, timely processing | Optional |
| **Confidentiality (C)** | Protection of confidential information | Optional |
| **Privacy (P)** | Collection, use, retention, disclosure of personal information | Optional |

<Note>
**Common Criteria (CC)** = Security controls (always required)
**Additional Criteria**: Select based on your service commitments (A, PI, C, P)
</Note>
