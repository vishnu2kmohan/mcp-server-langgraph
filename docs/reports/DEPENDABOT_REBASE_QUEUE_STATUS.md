# Dependabot Rebase Queue Status

**Updated**: 2025-10-13 13:25 UTC
**Status**: 🚀 **BATCH REBASE IN PROGRESS**

---

## Summary

Successfully triggered rebase for **11 Dependabot PRs** to incorporate the CI workflow fix:

- ✅ 2 Security patches (cryptography, PyJWT)
- ✅ 1 Grouped update (code-quality: flake8 + mypy)
- ✅ 3 Test framework updates (pytest-mock, pytest-xdist, respx)
- ✅ 5 CI/CD actions (azure/kubectl, actions/checkout, actions/labeler, actions/download-artifact, docker/build-push-action)

**Expected Processing Time**: 10-30 minutes per PR (Dependabot queue)

---

## PRs Queued for Rebase

### Priority 1: Security Patches 🔒

| PR | Package | Update | Risk | Status |
|----|---------|--------|------|--------|
| #32 | cryptography | 42.0.2 → 42.0.8 | 🟢 LOW (patch) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:08 UTC) |
| #30 | PyJWT | 2.8.0 → 2.10.1 | 🟢 LOW (minor) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:24 UTC) |

**Rationale**:
- cryptography: Patch version, backward compatible, addresses dependencies
- PyJWT: Minor version, security improvements, broad ecosystem use

### Priority 2: Grouped Updates 📦

| PR | Group | Updates | Risk | Status |
|----|-------|---------|------|--------|
| #35 | code-quality | flake8 7.0.0 → 7.3.0<br>mypy 1.8.0 → 1.18.2 | 🟢 LOW (grouped) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:24 UTC) |

**Rationale**:
- ✅ **Dependabot grouping is working!** This is our first grouped PR
- Both are development dependencies (linting/type checking)
- Minor version updates with backward compatibility
- Can be tested together as a unit

### Priority 3: Test Framework Updates 🧪

| PR | Package | Update | Risk | Status |
|----|---------|--------|------|--------|
| #31 | pytest-mock | 3.12.0 → 3.15.1 | 🟢 LOW (patch) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:25 UTC) |
| #28 | pytest-xdist | 3.5.0 → 3.8.0 | 🟢 LOW (minor) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:25 UTC) |
| #33 | respx | 0.20.2 → 0.22.0 | 🟢 LOW (minor) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:25 UTC) |

**Rationale**:
- All test dependencies (no runtime impact)
- Minor/patch versions (backward compatible)
- Should be grouped in future runs (testing-framework group)

**Note**: PR #36 (faker 22.0.0 → 37.11.0) not queued yet - major version, needs review

### Priority 4: CI/CD Actions 🔧

| PR | Action | Update | Risk | Status |
|----|--------|--------|------|--------|
| #27 | azure/setup-kubectl | 3 → 4 | 🟢 LOW (major, but isolated) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:24 UTC) |
| #26 | actions/checkout | 4 → 5 | 🟢 LOW (major, but isolated) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:24 UTC) |
| #25 | actions/labeler | 5 → 6 | 🟢 LOW (major, but isolated) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:24 UTC) |
| #21 | actions/download-artifact | 4 → 5 | 🟢 LOW (major, but isolated) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:24 UTC) |
| #20 | docker/build-push-action | 5 → 6 | 🟢 LOW (major, but isolated) | ⏳ Rebase queued (13:24 UTC) |

**Rationale**:
- GitHub Actions updates are isolated (don't affect app code)
- Well-tested by GitHub ecosystem
- Major versions but follow semver (breaking changes are minimal)
- Should be grouped in future runs (github-core-actions, cicd-actions groups)

## PRs NOT Queued (Need Review)

### Major Updates - High Risk 🔴

| PR | Package | Update | Risk | Reason Not Queued |
|----|---------|--------|------|-------------------|
| #22 | langgraph | 0.2.28 → 0.6.10 | 🔴 HIGH (4 minor versions) | Requires feature branch + 2-week testing |
| #23 | fastapi | 0.109.0 → 0.119.0 | 🟡 MEDIUM (1 minor) | Requires REST endpoint testing |
| #29 | openfga-sdk | 0.5.0 → 0.9.7 | 🟡 MEDIUM (4 minor) | Requires authorization testing |
| #36 | faker | 22.0.0 → 37.11.0 | 🟡 MEDIUM (major jump) | Test dependency but major version |

**Next Steps for These**:
1. **langgraph**: Create feature branch, comprehensive testing (Week 3-4)
2. **fastapi**: Test REST endpoints, check breaking changes (Week 2)
3. **openfga-sdk**: Test authorization flows (Week 2)
4. **faker**: Review changelog, test suite still passes (Week 1-2)

## What Happens Next (Automatic)

### Phase 1: Dependabot Rebase (10-30 min per PR)
For each of the 11 queued PRs:
1. Dependabot fetches latest main branch (602b0fb)
2. Rebases PR branch with main (includes CI fix)
3. Force-pushes rebased branch
4. Updates PR with new SHA
5. Triggers GitHub Actions CI

### Phase 2: CI Execution (5-10 min per PR)
For each rebased PR:
1. ✅ Package installation will work (`pip install -e .` is now present)
2. ✅ Test jobs (Python 3.10/3.11/3.12) should PASS
3. ✅ Lint job should PASS
4. ✅ Security job should PASS
5. ✅ Other checks should benefit from proper setup

**Previously Failing** (should now PASS):
- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_server_langgraph' → **RESOLVED**
- Test on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 → **SHOULD PASS**
- Code Quality → **SHOULD PASS**
- Lint → **SHOULD PASS**

### Phase 3: Manual Review and Merge (2-5 min per PR)
After CI passes on each PR:
```bash
# Review CI results
gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER>

# Approve
gh pr review <PR-NUMBER> --approve --body "✅ CI passing, approved for merge"

# Merge
gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --squash --delete-branch
```

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Rebase Status
```bash
# List all PRs with current SHA and update time
gh pr list --author "app/dependabot" --state open \
  --json number,title,headRefOid,updatedAt \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.number): \(.headRefOid[0:7]) (\(.updatedAt[:16]))"'
```

### Check CI Status
```bash
# Check specific PR
gh pr checks 32

# Check all PRs
for pr in 32 30 35 31 28 33 27 26 25 21 20; do
  echo "=== PR #$pr ==="
  gh pr checks $pr --json name,status,conclusion \
    --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion != "success") | .name'
  echo
done
```

### Bulk Approve and Merge (After CI Passes)
```bash
# Approve all PRs with passing CI
for pr in 32 30 35 31 28 33 27 26 25 21 20; do
  # Check if CI is passing
  if gh pr checks $pr --json conclusion \
     --jq '.[] | .conclusion' | grep -q "failure"; then
    echo "⚠️  PR #$pr has failing checks, skipping"
  else
    echo "✅ Approving PR #$pr"
    gh pr review $pr --approve --body "✅ CI passing, approved for merge"
    gh pr merge $pr --squash --delete-branch
    echo "---"
  fi
done
```

## Key Insights

### Dependabot Grouping is Working! 🎉
PR #35 is our **first grouped PR** from the new configuration:
- Group: `code-quality`
- Updates: flake8 + mypy together
- Exactly as configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`

**Expected Future Groups** (on next Monday run):
- `testing-framework`: pytest*, respx, faker, hypothesis*
- `opentelemetry`: opentelemetry-* packages
- `aws-sdk`: boto3, botocore, aiobotocore
- `github-core-actions`: actions/* packages
- `cicd-actions`: docker/*, azure/*, codecov/*

### CI Fix Enables Systematic Merging
Before: 10+ failing checks blocking all PRs
After: Clean CI runs enable batch merging

**Impact**: Can merge 11 PRs in rapid succession once CI passes

### Risk-Based Batching Working Well
- Low-risk PRs (11): Queued for immediate merge
- Medium-risk PRs (3): Held for functional testing
- High-risk PRs (1): Held for feature branch + 2-week testing
