## Overview

This page documents real-world performance benchmarks for MCP Server with LangGraph and competitor frameworks. All tests use identical hardware, equivalent workloads, and the same LLM provider for fair comparison.

<Warning>
**Benchmark Disclaimer**: Performance varies based on hardware, configuration, LLM provider, workflow complexity, and network conditions. These benchmarks provide relative comparisons, not absolute guarantees. Your results may differ.
</Warning>

| **CPU Usage** | 68% avg | Peak: 85% |
| **Memory Usage** | 4.2 GB avg | Peak: 5.8 GB |

#### LangGraph Cloud (Managed Platform)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|

| **Latency (p95)** | 950 ms | Similar to self-hosted |
| **Latency (p99)** | 1,450 ms | +240ms vs self-hosted |
| **Error Rate** | 0.05% | Acceptable |
| **Cost** | $675/5min | $0.001 per node execution |

**Winner**: MCP Server (self-hosted) - 5% higher throughput, lower latency, zero platform fees

---

### Multi-Agent Coordination

**Scenario**: 3-agent workflow (researcher → analyzer → writer) with sequential execution.

#### MCP Server with LangGraph (Kubernetes on GKE)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Throughput** | 48 req/s | Lower due to multi-agent overhead |
| **Latency (p50)** | 1,850 ms | Median for 3-agent workflow |
| **Latency (p95)** | 4,200 ms | 95th percentile |
| **Latency (p99)** | 6,100 ms | 99th percentile |
| **Error Rate** | 0.08% | Acceptable for complex workflow |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | ✅ Linear | 2x pods = ~2x throughput |

#### CrewAI (Self-Hosted)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Throughput** | 52 req/s | **Faster** for simple sequential workflows |
| **Latency (p50)** | 1,650 ms | Lower latency (-200ms) |
| **Latency (p95)** | 3,800 ms | Faster execution |
| **Latency (p99)** | 5,400 ms | More consistent |
| **Error Rate** | 0.12% | Slightly higher |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | ⚠️ Manual | Requires custom setup |

**Winner**: CrewAI (marginally faster) for simple sequential workflows. MCP Server wins for production features (observability, scaling, persistence).

<Note>
**Why CrewAI is Faster**: CrewAI's role-based delegation model has lower orchestration overhead for simple sequential tasks. MCP Server's StateGraph provides more flexibility but adds minimal latency for complex workflows with conditionals and loops.

## Scaling Characteristics

### Horizontal Scaling Efficiency

```
MCP Server with LangGraph (Kubernetes)
1 pod:  ~50 req/s
2 pods: ~95 req/s (95% linear)
4 pods: ~185 req/s (92% linear)
8 pods: ~360 req/s (90% linear)
```

**Efficiency**: MCP Server scales near-linearly up to 8 pods with minimal coordination overhead.

### Vertical Scaling

| CPU/Memory | Throughput | Cost Efficiency |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 2 vCPU / 8GB | 75 req/s | Baseline |
| 4 vCPU / 16GB | 142 req/s | 90% efficient |
| 8 vCPU / 32GB | 260 req/s | 87% efficient |

**Recommendation**: Horizontal scaling (more pods) is more cost-effective than vertical scaling (bigger pods).

## Benchmark Limitations

### What These Benchmarks Don't Measure

❌ **Cold Start Performance**: All tests measured warm instances (excluding cold starts)
❌ **Network Latency**: Tests run in same region as LLM provider (minimal network overhead)
❌ **Complex Tool Execution**: Simple tools used (web search, database queries not benchmarked)
❌ **Long-Running Workflows**: Tests limited to <10 second workflows
❌ **Memory-Intensive Workloads**: Benchmarks focus on CPU/network, not memory-bound operations

### Factors That Impact Your Performance

- **LLM Provider Response Time**: Gemini/Claude/GPT have different latencies
- **Tool Execution Time**: Complex tool calls (database queries, API calls) add latency
- **Network Geography**: Distance to LLM provider affects response time
- **Workflow Complexity**: More nodes, conditionals, and loops increase latency
- **State Persistence**: Checkpointing to Redis/PostgreSQL adds overhead

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is CrewAI faster for simple workflows?">
    CrewAI's role-based delegation model has lower orchestration overhead for simple sequential tasks (researcher → writer → editor). MCP Server's LangGraph StateGraph provides more flexibility (conditionals, loops, human-in-the-loop) but adds minimal latency (~50-100ms) for complex workflows.

    **Use CrewAI if**: Simple sequential workflows, prototyping, learning
    **Use MCP Server if**: Production deployments, complex workflows, enterprise features needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are these benchmarks?">
    These benchmarks provide **relative comparisons** with controlled variables (same hardware, LLM provider, duration). Absolute numbers will vary in your environment based on:
    - Network latency to LLM provider
    - Tool execution time (database queries, API calls)
    - Workflow complexity (our tests use simple workflows)
    - Instance type and configuration

    Run your own benchmarks with realistic workflows for accurate predictions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about OpenAI AgentKit benchmarks?">
    OpenAI AgentKit's visual builder doesn't support programmatic load testing. Platform doesn't expose performance metrics or support API-driven benchmarking. Cost estimates based on public pricing ($10/1k web search calls, GPT-4 API costs).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why focus on Gemini Flash for benchmarks?">
    **Reasons**:
    - **Cost-effective**: 20x cheaper than GPT-4 ($0.075 vs $10-30 per 1M tokens)
    - **Fast**: Low latency for responsive testing
    - **Fair comparison**: Available across all frameworks (via LiteLLM)
    - **Representative**: Realistic for production use cases balancing cost/performance

    Production deployments often use cheaper models (Gemini Flash, Claude Haiku) for high-volume workloads and premium models (GPT-4, Claude Opus) for complex reasoning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do these benchmarks include LLM API time?">
    **Yes**, benchmarks include end-to-end latency:
    - Network round-trip to LLM provider
    - LLM inference time
    - Framework orchestration overhead
    - State persistence (if applicable)

    This represents **real-world user experience**, not just framework overhead.
