## When to Choose Each Option

### Choose LangGraph Cloud Only When:

- ✅ **Serverless Priority** - You only want serverless, never self-host
- ✅ **No DevOps Team** - Don't want to manage infrastructure
- ✅ **Quick Prototyping** - Need fastest time-to-deployment (2 minutes)
- ✅ **Low Volume** - Under 100K requests/month (free tier)
- ✅ **No Compliance** - Not subject to GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2
- ✅ **Simple Auth** - API keys are sufficient

**Example Use Cases:**
- Personal projects
- Proofs of concept
- Hackathons
- Low-traffic applications
- Non-regulated industries

### Choose MCP Server with LangGraph When:

- ✅ **Deployment Flexibility** - Want option to self-host or use Platform
- ✅ **Cost Optimization** - High volume (&gt;1M requests/month)
- ✅ **Enterprise Security** - Need JWT, SSO, OpenFGA
- ✅ **Compliance Required** - GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, data residency
- ✅ **Multi-Cloud Strategy** - Want to avoid vendor lock-in
- ✅ **Complete Observability** - Need LangSmith + OTEL + Grafana
- ✅ **MCP Protocol** - Building MCP-compatible integrations
- ✅ **On-Premises** - Need to deploy in private cloud

**Example Use Cases:**
- Enterprise production applications
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- High-volume applications (millions of requests)
- Multi-region deployments
- Hybrid cloud architectures
- Organizations with DevOps teams

## Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

<Info>
  **Recommended Strategy:** Use MCP Server with LangGraph and deploy to LangGraph Cloud initially, then migrate to self-hosted as you scale.
</Info>

**Development:** LangGraph Cloud (2-minute deployment)
**Staging:** Cloud Run or Kubernetes (test production config)
**Production:** Kubernetes (cost-optimized, enterprise features)

**Benefits:**
- Start fast with Platform
- Migrate to self-hosted when ready
- No code changes needed (same LangGraph code)
- Optimize costs as you grow

## Migration Paths

### From LangGraph Cloud to MCP Server (Self-Hosted)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use MCP Server with LangGraph">
    Your existing LangGraph code works without changes:
    ```python
    # Your existing LangGraph agent code
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

    graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
    # ... same code ...

    # Works on Platform AND self-hosted
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Enterprise Features">
    - Configure JWT authentication (optional)
    - Set up OpenFGA authorization (optional)
    - Enable LangSmith + OTEL (optional)
    - Configure Infisical secrets (optional)

    **Note:** All enterprise features are optional. Start simple, add as needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Deployment Target">
    **Prototype:** Keep using LangGraph Cloud
    ```bash
    langgraph deploy
    ```

    **Scale:** Deploy to Cloud Run
    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy --source .
    ```

    **Enterprise:** Deploy to Kubernetes
    ```bash
    helm install mcp-server ./deployments/helm
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optimize Costs">
    Monitor costs in LangSmith and decide when to migrate:
    - Platform OK: &lt;100K requests/month
    - Consider Cloud Run: &gt;1M requests/month
    - Consider Kubernetes: &gt;10M requests/month
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Feature Parity Matrix

| Feature Category | LangGraph Cloud | MCP Server with LangGraph |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Core LangGraph** | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% (same version) |
| **Deployment Options** | ⚠️ Platform only | ✅ Platform + 4 others |
| **Authentication** | ⚠️ API keys | ✅ JWT + SSO |
| **Authorization** | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Enterprise ([Google Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/)) |
| **Observability** | ⚠️ LangSmith only | ✅ LangSmith + OTEL |
| **Security** | ⚠️ Platform-level | ✅ Custom network policies |
| **Compliance** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 |
| **Cost at Scale** | ⚠️ Expensive | ✅ Optimizable (10-50x) |
| **MCP Protocol** | ❌ No | ✅ Native |
| **Documentation** | ✅ LangGraph docs | ✅ Complete + deployment |

## Honest Recommendation

### If You're Starting Out:
- **Use MCP Server with LangGraph** and deploy to LangGraph Cloud initially
- Get the flexibility to self-host later without code changes
- Start simple, add enterprise features as needed

### If You're Enterprise:
- **Use MCP Server with LangGraph** - you'll need the enterprise features (auth, compliance, observability)
- Start on Platform for staging, deploy to Kubernetes for production

### If You're Cost-Sensitive:
- **Prototype:** MCP Server with LangGraph on Platform (free tier)
- **Production:** Self-host on Cloud Run or Kubernetes (10-50x cheaper)

### If You Never Want Infrastructure:
- **Use LangGraph Cloud Only** - but recognize the trade-offs (cost, compliance, vendor lock-in)

### When NOT to Use MCP Server with LangGraph:

**Choose LangGraph Cloud instead if:**
- ❌ **Absolutely no infrastructure management** - You never want to think about Kubernetes, Docker, or servers
- ❌ **Sub-100K requests/month permanently** - LangGraph Cloud's free tier is perfect for low-volume projects
- ❌ **2-minute deployment is critical** - Every hour counts and you can't spare setup time
- ❌ **LangChain ecosystem commitment** - You're fully invested in LangChain and comfortable with platform lock-in
- ❌ **No DevOps team ever** - Your organization will never have infrastructure expertise

**MCP Server is overkill if:**
- You're building hobby projects or internal tools with minimal traffic
- You prefer platform-managed everything (backups, scaling, security)
- You're okay paying premium for convenience ($5K/mo vs $500/mo at 1M requests)
- Your use case will never require compliance certifications or multi-cloud

## Summary

**The Real Comparison:**

| Criteria | LangGraph Cloud Only | MCP Server with LangGraph |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **LangGraph Support** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (same capabilities) |
| **Deployment Flexibility** | ❌ No (Platform only) | ✅ Yes (Platform + 4 options) |
| **Enterprise Security** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Complete |
| **Cost at Scale** | ⚠️ Expensive | ✅ Optimizable |
| **MCP Protocol** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (native server) |
| **Time to Deploy** | 🏆 2 minutes | ✅ 2 min - 2 hours (flexible) |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | ⚠️ Yes (LangChain) | ✅ No (portable) |
| **Compliance** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Complete |

**Bottom Line:** MCP Server with LangGraph = LangGraph Cloud + Enterprise Features + Multi-Cloud + MCP Protocol

You're not choosing between LangGraph Cloud and MCP Server with LangGraph. You're choosing between **LangGraph Cloud only** vs **LangGraph Cloud + flexibility + enterprise features**.
