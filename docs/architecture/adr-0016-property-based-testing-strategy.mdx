### Status

Accepted

### Context

Traditional unit tests check specific examples:
```python
assert calculate_discount(100, 0.1) == 90
```python
Edge cases often missed:
- Negative numbers
- Zero values
- Very large numbers
- Unicode in strings

### Decision

Use **Hypothesis for property-based testing** to discover edge cases automatically.

#### Example

```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis.strategies import integers, floats

@given(price=floats(min_value=0), discount=floats(min_value=0, max_value=1))
def test_discount_properties(price, discount):
    result = calculate_discount(price, discount)
    assert result >= 0  # Never negative
    assert result <= price  # Never more than original
```

Hypothesis generates 100+ test cases including edge cases.

### Consequences

#### Positive

- **Edge Case Discovery**: Finds bugs unit tests miss
- **Higher Confidence**: Tests properties, not examples
- **Less Test Code**: One property test replaces many examples
- **Regression Prevention**: Generated cases saved on failure

#### Negative

- **Slower Tests**: 100 cases per test vs 1
- **Learning Curve**: Property thinking vs example thinking
- **Flaky Tests**: Random generation can cause intermittent failures

### Usage

27+ property tests covering:
- LLM factory fallback logic
- Authentication providers
- Session management
- Role mapping
