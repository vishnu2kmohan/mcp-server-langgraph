# ADR-0067: Non-Root Container Security Strategy

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-12-07
**Author**: Claude Code
**Decision Makers**: Vishnu Mohan

## Context

During CI troubleshooting for E2E tests, we discovered that several containers in `docker-compose.test.yml` were running as root or had file permission issues that caused failures in CI but not locally. This highlighted the need for a comprehensive non-root container security strategy that:

1. Aligns local development with CI and production Kubernetes deployments
2. Supports OpenShift's Security Context Constraints (SCC)
3. Follows container security best practices
4. Documents exceptions where root is required

### Problem Statement

- **Loki container** crashed with "permission denied" on config file and tmpfs storage
- **Qdrant** and **Traefik** were running as root, inconsistent with Kubernetes policies
- Local development didn't catch these issues due to different file ownership contexts
- No documented strategy for container UID/GID selection

## Decision

### 1. Non-Root by Default

All containers MUST run as non-root users unless there is a documented, justified exception.

### 2. UID/GID Strategy

Use the UID specified by the upstream container image maintainer rather than standardizing on a single UID:

| Container | UID | Image Source |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| Loki | 10001 | grafana/loki |
| Prometheus | 65534 (nobody) | prom/prometheus |
| Alertmanager | 65534 (nobody) | prom/alertmanager |
| Grafana | 472 | grafana/grafana |
| Jaeger | 10001 | jaegertracing/all-in-one |
| Keycloak | 1000 | quay.io/keycloak/keycloak |
| Qdrant | 1000 | qdrant/qdrant:*-unprivileged |
| Traefik | 1000 | traefik:v3.x (with high ports) |
| PostgreSQL | 70 | postgres:*-alpine |
| Redis | 999 | redis:*-alpine |

### 3. tmpfs Ownership

When using tmpfs mounts for ephemeral storage, explicitly set UID/GID ownership:

```yaml
tmpfs:
  - /path:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=256m,uid=10001,gid=10001
```

### 4. Config File Permissions

All mounted config files MUST have mode 644 (world-readable) to support containers running as non-root:

```bash
# Correct: World-readable
-rw-r--r-- loki-config.yaml

# Incorrect: Owner-only (breaks non-root containers)
-rw------- loki-config.yaml
```

### 5. Privileged Port Handling

For services requiring ports < 1024, use internal high ports with port mapping:

```yaml
traefik-gateway:
  user: "1000:1000"
  command:
    - "--entrypoints.web.address=:8000"  # High port internally
  ports:
    - "80:8000"  # External 80 -> internal 8000
```

### 6. Documented Exceptions

**Promtail** is the only container allowed to run as root because:
- Requires read access to Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
- Needs to read container log files owned by various UIDs
- No practical non-root alternative without losing functionality

### 7. OpenShift Compatibility

For OpenShift deployments, containers must support arbitrary UIDs with GID 0:

```dockerfile
# Set ownership to root group (GID 0) for OpenShift compatibility
RUN chown -R 1000:0 /app && chmod -R g=u /app
```

OpenShift's `restricted` SCC assigns random UIDs at runtime but preserves GID 0 membership.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Security parity**: Local, CI, and production environments use consistent non-root policies
- **Earlier failure detection**: Permission issues caught locally instead of CI
- **OpenShift ready**: Containers work with OpenShift's restrictive SCC
- **Reduced attack surface**: Compromised containers cannot easily escalate privileges
- **Compliance**: Meets SOC 2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS container security requirements

### Negative

- **Minor complexity**: Must track different UIDs for different images
- **Port restrictions**: Services requiring port below 1024 need port mapping configuration
- **Image selection**: Must use `-unprivileged` variants when available (e.g., Qdrant)
- **File permissions**: Config files must be world-readable (acceptable for non-secret configs)

### Neutral

- **No performance impact**: Non-root execution has negligible overhead
- **Promtail exception**: Documented and accepted for log collection functionality

## Implementation

### Completed (PR #144)

1. ✅ Loki: tmpfs with `uid=10001,gid=10001`
2. ✅ Qdrant: Changed to `qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.5-unprivileged` with `user: "1000:1000"`
3. ✅ Traefik: High ports (8000/8081) with `user: "1000:1000"`
4. ✅ Config file permissions documented

### Future Work

1. Update Dockerfiles for OpenShift GID 0 compatibility
2. Add pre-commit hook to validate container UIDs in docker-compose files
3. Document in `deployments/README.md`
