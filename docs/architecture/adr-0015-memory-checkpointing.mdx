### Status

Accepted

### Context

Conversational agents need:
- Multi-turn conversations
- Context retention
- State persistence across restarts

Stateless agents lose context every request, degrading UX.

### Decision

Use **LangGraph MemorySaver** for conversation state checkpointing.

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

### Consequences

#### Positive

- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Context preserved
- **User Experience**: Natural conversation flow
- **State Recovery**: Resume after crashes

#### Negative

- **Memory Usage**: State grows with conversations
- **Persistence**: MemorySaver not persistent (future: Redis)

### Future Enhancements

- Redis checkpointer for distributed deployments
- State compression for long conversations
