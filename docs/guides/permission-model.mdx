### Overview

Create custom authorization models in OpenFGA to match your application's permission requirements. This guide covers model design, testing, and best practices.

### Authorization Model Language

OpenFGA models are defined in a simple DSL:

```typescript
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type organization
  relations
    define admin: [user]
    define member: [user] or admin
```
#### Key Concepts

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Types" icon="cube">
    Objects in your system (user, organization, document)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relations" icon="link">
    Relationships between objects (admin, member, viewer)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conditions" icon="filter">
    Context-based permissions (time, IP, attributes)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Default Model

The MCP Server includes this model:

```typescript
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type role
  relations
    define assignee: [user]

type organization
  relations
    define admin: [user]
    define member: [user] or admin
    define viewer: [user] or member

type tool
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define executor: [user, organization#member]
    define viewer: [user, organization#member]

type conversation
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user]
    define viewer: [user] or editor or owner

type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user]
    define viewer: [user] or editor or owner
```

**Supported Patterns**:
- Hierarchical roles (admin → member → viewer)
- Organization-based access (organization#member)
- Resource ownership
- Delegated permissions

### Custom Models

#### Example: Project Management

```typescript
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type team
  relations
    define lead: [user]
    define member: [user] or lead

type project
  relations
    define owner: [team#lead]
    define contributor: [team#member]
    define viewer: [user] or contributor

type task
  relations
    define project: [project]
    define assignee: [user]
    define viewer: [user] from project
```
**Usage**:
```python
## Team lead creates project
await client.write_tuples([
    {"user": "user:alice", "relation": "lead", "object": "team:engineering"},
    {"user": "team:engineering#lead", "relation": "owner", "object": "project:webapp"}
])

## Alice can view project (via team lead)
allowed = await client.check_permission(
    user="user:alice",
    relation="viewer",
    object="project:webapp"
)
## Returns: True
```

#### Example: Multi-Tenant SaaS

```typescript
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type tenant
  relations
    define admin: [user]
    define member: [user] or admin

type workspace
  relations
    define tenant: [tenant]
    define admin: [user, tenant#admin]
    define member: [user, tenant#member] or admin

type resource
  relations
    define workspace: [workspace]
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user, workspace#member]
    define viewer: [user] or editor
```
**Isolation**:
```python
## Tenant A admin
await client.write_tuples([
    {"user": "user:alice", "relation": "admin", "object": "tenant:company_a"},
    {"user": "tenant:company_a", "relation": "tenant", "object": "workspace:ws1"}
])

## Alice can access workspace (via tenant admin)
allowed = await client.check_permission(
    user="user:alice",
    relation="admin",
    object="workspace:ws1"
)
## Returns: True
```

#### Example: Content Management

```typescript
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type folder
  relations
    define parent: [folder]
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user]
    define viewer: [user] or editor or owner or viewer from parent

type file
  relations
    define parent: [folder]
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user]
    define viewer: [user] or editor or owner or viewer from parent
```
**Inheritance**:
```python
## Set folder permissions
await client.write_tuples([
    {"user": "user:alice", "relation": "owner", "object": "folder:docs"},
    {"user": "folder:docs", "relation": "parent", "object": "file:report.pdf"}
])

## Alice can view file (inherited from folder)
allowed = await client.check_permission(
    user="user:alice",
    relation="viewer",
    object="file:report.pdf"
)
## Returns: True
```

### Relation Operators

#### Direct Assignment

```typescript
define admin: [user]
```
Users directly assigned admin relation.

#### Union (OR)

```typescript
define member: [user] or admin
```
User is member OR admin.

#### Intersection (AND)

```typescript
define can_delete: admin and owner
```
User must be admin AND owner.

#### Exclusion (BUT NOT)

```typescript
define active_member: member but not suspended
```

User is member but not suspended.

#### Computed Relations

```typescript
define viewer: [user] or viewer from parent
```
User is viewer OR inherits from parent.

### Conditional Permissions

Add context-based rules:

```typescript
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define viewer: [user with time_limited_access]

condition time_limited_access(current_time: timestamp, expiry: timestamp) {
  current_time < expiry
}
```

**Usage**:
```python
## Check with context
allowed = await client.check_permission(
    user="user:bob",
    relation="viewer",
    object="document:report",
    context={
        "current_time": "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z",
        "expiry": "2025-10-13T10:00:00Z"
    }
)
```
### Testing Models

#### Model Validation

```bash
## Use OpenFGA CLI
fga model validate --file model.fga

## Or via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stores/{store_id}/authorization-models \
  -d @model.json
```

#### Test Assertions

```python
test_cases = [
    {
        "user": "user:alice",
        "relation": "admin",
        "object": "organization:acme",
        "expected": True
    },
    {
        "user": "user:bob",
        "relation": "admin",
        "object": "organization:acme",
        "expected": False
    }
]

for test in test_cases:
    result = await client.check_permission(
        user=test["user"],
        relation=test["relation"],
        object=test["object"]
    )
    assert result == test["expected"], f"Test failed: {test}"
```
### Deploying Models

#### Via Setup Script

Update `scripts/setup/setup_openfga.py`:

```python
AUTHORIZATION_MODEL = {
    "schema_version": "1.1",
    "type_definitions": [
        {
            "type": "user"
        },
        {
            "type": "organization",
            "relations": {
                "admin": {"this": {}},
                "member": {
                    "union": {
                        "child": [
                            {"this": {}},
                            {"computedUserset": {"relation": "admin"}}
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

## Write model
response = await client.write_authorization_model(AUTHORIZATION_MODEL)
model_id = response["authorization_model_id"]
```

#### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stores/{store_id}/authorization-models \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "schema_version": "1.1",
    "type_definitions": [...]
  }'
```
### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with basic types and relations. Add complexity as needed.

    **Good**:
    ```typescript
    type document
      relations
        define owner: [user]
        define viewer: [user]
    ```
    **Too Complex**:
    ```typescript
    type document
      relations
        define owner: [user]
        define editor: [user, group#member, team#lead]
        define viewer: [user] or editor or viewer from parent or viewer from workspace
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Hierarchies" icon="layer-group">
    Define role hierarchies to reduce tuple count.

    ```typescript
    type organization
      relations
        define admin: [user]
        define member: [user] or admin  # Admins are members
        define viewer: [user] or member # Members are viewers
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit Indirection" icon="arrows-turn-right">
    Too many hops slow down checks.

    **Good** (2 hops):
    ```typescript
    define viewer: [user] or viewer from parent
    ```
    **Bad** (5+ hops):
    ```typescript
    define viewer: [user] or viewer from parent from grandparent from workspace from tenant
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Name Consistently" icon="tag">
    Use consistent naming across your model.

    - **Types**: Singular (user, document, not users)
    - **Relations**: Lowercase (admin, not Admin)
    - **IDs**: Prefixed (user:123, not 123)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Models" icon="code-branch">
    Track model changes and test migrations.

    ```python
    # v1 model
    model_v1 = {...}

    # v2 model (add new type)
    model_v2 = {...}

    # Test migration
    # 1. Create v2 model
    # 2. Verify v1 tuples still work
    # 3. Add v2 tuples
    # 4. Switch to v2
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Optimization

#### Reduce Tuple Count

Use group/organization relations instead of per-user tuples:

**Bad** (100 tuples for 100 users):
```python
for user_id in range(100):
    await client.write_tuples([{
        "user": f"user:{user_id}",
        "relation": "viewer",
        "object": "document:report"
    }])
```

**Good** (1 tuple):
```python
await client.write_tuples([{
    "user": "organization:company#member",
    "relation": "viewer",
    "object": "document:report"
}])
```
#### Add Indexes

For PostgreSQL backend, add indexes on frequently queried fields.

#### Enable Caching

```python
client = OpenFGAClient(
    cache_ttl=300,  # 5 minutes
    cache_backend="redis"
)
```
### Migration Guide

#### Adding New Types

1. Create new model with added type
2. Write new model to OpenFGA
3. No data migration needed

#### Modifying Relations

1. Create new model
2. Write new model
3. Migrate existing tuples if needed

```python
## Old: "can_read" relation
old_tuples = await client.read_tuples(relation="can_read")

## New: "viewer" relation
new_tuples = [{
    "user": t["user"],
    "relation": "viewer",  # Changed
    "object": t["object"]
} for t in old_tuples]

await client.write_tuples(new_tuples)
await client.delete_tuples(old_tuples)
```
