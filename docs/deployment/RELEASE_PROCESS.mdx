# Release Process

This document describes the automated and manual release process for MCP Server LangGraph.

## Overview

The project uses automated GitHub Actions workflows to:
1. Build and publish Docker images
2. Package and publish Helm charts
3. Automatically update deployment configuration versions
4. Publish to PyPI
5. Update the MCP Registry

## Automated Release Process

### How It Works

When a new GitHub release is created, two automated workflows run:

#### 1. Release Notes Generation (`.github/workflows/release.yaml`)

The release workflow automatically:

1. **Extracts CHANGELOG content** from `CHANGELOG.md` for the release version
2. **Adds deployment instructions** (Docker pull, Helm commands, documentation links)
3. **Creates the GitHub release** with comprehensive description
4. **Falls back to commit log** if CHANGELOG section not found (with warning)

**Example**: For release `v2.6.0`, the workflow extracts content between `## [2.6.0]` and the next `---` or `## [` in CHANGELOG.md

**Important**: Always update CHANGELOG.md before creating a release. The release description is automatically generated from it!

#### 2. Version Bump Automation (`bump-deployment-versions` workflow)

When a new GitHub release is published, the `bump-deployment-versions` workflow automatically:

1. **Extracts the version** from the release tag (e.g., `v2.5.0` → `2.5.0`)
2. **Updates all deployment files**:
   - `pyproject.toml` - Python package version
   - `package.json` - npm package version
   - `src/mcp_server_langgraph/core/config.py` - service_version
   - `.mcp/manifest.json` - MCP manifest version
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Version comment
   - `deployments/kubernetes/base/deployment.yaml` - Container image tag
   - `deployments/helm/mcp-server-langgraph/Chart.yaml` - Chart version and appVersion
   - `deployments/helm/mcp-server-langgraph/values.yaml` - Image tag
   - `deployments/kustomize/base/kustomization.yaml` - Image tag
3. **Commits the changes** to the main branch
4. **Adds a comment** to the release with deployment commands

### Triggering a Release

#### Option 1: GitHub UI (Recommended)

1. Go to https://github.com/vishnu2kmohan/mcp-server-langgraph/releases/new
2. Click "Choose a tag"
3. Create a new tag following semantic versioning (e.g., `v2.5.0`)
4. Fill in the release title (e.g., "Release v2.5.0")
5. Add release notes (GitHub will auto-generate from commits)
6. Click "Publish release"

The workflow will automatically:
- Build Docker images for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- Push images to ghcr.io
- Package and publish Helm chart
- Update deployment versions
- Publish to PyPI (for non-prerelease versions)

#### Option 2: Git Tag + Push

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v2.5.0
git push origin v2.5.0

# Then create the release on GitHub UI
# Or use GitHub CLI
gh release create v2.5.0 --generate-notes
```

#### Option 3: GitHub CLI

```bash
# Create release with auto-generated notes
gh release create v2.5.0 --generate-notes

# Create release with custom notes
gh release create v2.5.0 --notes "Release notes here"

# Create pre-release
gh release create v2.5.0-beta.1 --prerelease --notes "Beta release"
```

### Version Format

Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, backward compatible

**Tag format**: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}[-{prerelease}]`

**Examples**:
- `v2.5.0` - Standard release
- `v2.5.1` - Patch release
- `v3.0.0` - Major release (breaking changes)
- `v2.5.0-beta.1` - Beta pre-release
- `v2.5.0-rc.1` - Release candidate

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions (alpha, beta, rc) are handled specially:

- ✅ Docker images are built and pushed
- ✅ Helm charts are packaged
- ✅ Deployment versions are updated
- ❌ Not published to PyPI
- ❌ Not marked as "latest" release
- ❌ Not published to MCP Registry

**Creating a pre-release**:

```bash
# GitHub UI: Check "Set as a pre-release"
# GitHub CLI:
gh release create v2.5.0-beta.1 --prerelease --notes "Beta release for testing"
```

## Manual Version Bumping

If you need to update versions manually (outside of a release):

### Using the Script

```bash
# Test with dry run first
DRY_RUN=1 bash scripts/deployment/bump-versions.sh 2.5.0

# Review the proposed changes
# If everything looks good, apply the changes
bash scripts/deployment/bump-versions.sh 2.5.0

# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: bump deployment versions to 2.5.0"
git push origin main
```

### Using GitHub Actions (Manual Trigger)

1. Go to: https://github.com/vishnu2kmohan/mcp-server-langgraph/actions/workflows/bump-deployment-versions.yaml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the version (e.g., `2.5.0` or `v2.5.0`)
4. Click "Run workflow"

The workflow will:
- Update all deployment files
- Commit changes
- Push to main branch

## Deployment After Release

After a release is published and versions are updated, deploy using:

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Pull latest images
docker compose pull

# Restart services
docker compose up -d

# Verify version
docker compose exec agent python -c "from mcp_server_langgraph import __version__; print(__version__)"
```

### Kubernetes (kubectl)

```bash
# Update deployment image
kubectl set image deployment/mcp-server-langgraph \
  mcp-server-langgraph=ghcr.io/vishnu2kmohan/mcp-server-langgraph:2.5.0 \
  -n mcp-server-langgraph

# Or apply the updated manifests
kubectl apply -f deployments/kubernetes/base/

# Verify rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/mcp-server-langgraph -n mcp-server-langgraph
```

### Helm

```bash
# Update from local chart
helm upgrade --install mcp-server-langgraph \
  deployments/helm/mcp-server-langgraph \
  --set image.tag=2.5.0 \
  --namespace mcp-server-langgraph

# Or from OCI registry (after release publishes)
helm upgrade --install mcp-server-langgraph \
  oci://ghcr.io/vishnu2kmohan/mcp-server-langgraph/charts/mcp-server-langgraph \
  --version 2.5.0 \
  --namespace mcp-server-langgraph
```

### Kustomize

```bash
# Development
kubectl apply -k deployments/kustomize/overlays/dev

# Staging
kubectl apply -k deployments/kustomize/overlays/staging

# Production
kubectl apply -k deployments/kustomize/overlays/production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Version Bump Workflow Failed

1. Check workflow logs: https://github.com/vishnu2kmohan/mcp-server-langgraph/actions
2. Common issues:
   - Invalid version format → Fix tag and re-run
   - Permission denied → Check GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
   - Merge conflict → Manually resolve and push

**Manual fix**:
```bash
# Re-run the version bump manually
bash scripts/deployment/bump-versions.sh 2.5.0
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: bump deployment versions to 2.5.0"
git push origin main
```

### Docker Image Build Failed

1. Check build logs in GitHub Actions
2. Common issues:
   - Dependency installation failure → Update requirements.txt
   - Platform-specific build error → Check Dockerfile
   - Registry authentication → Check GITHUB_TOKEN

**Manual build**:
```bash
# Build multi-platform image
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t ghcr.io/vishnu2kmohan/mcp-server-langgraph:2.5.0 \
  --push .
```

### Helm Chart Publication Failed

1. Check Helm packaging in workflow logs
2. Common issues:
   - Chart validation error → Run `helm lint deployments/helm/mcp-server-langgraph`
   - OCI push failure → Check registry authentication

**Manual publish**:
```bash
# Package chart
helm package deployments/helm/mcp-server-langgraph --version 2.5.0

# Push to OCI registry
helm push mcp-server-langgraph-2.5.0.tgz \
  oci://ghcr.io/vishnu2kmohan/mcp-server-langgraph/charts
```

### Version Mismatch

If deployment versions don't match the release:

```bash
# Check current versions
grep "version" pyproject.toml
grep "Version:" docker-compose.yml
grep "image:" deployments/kubernetes/base/deployment.yaml
grep "tag:" deployments/helm/mcp-server-langgraph/values.yaml

# Re-run version bump
bash scripts/deployment/bump-versions.sh 2.5.0

# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: synchronize deployment versions to 2.5.0"
git push origin main
```

## Rollback

If you need to rollback a release:

### Rollback Deployment

```bash
# Kubernetes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mcp-server-langgraph -n mcp-server-langgraph

# Helm
helm rollback mcp-server-langgraph -n mcp-server-langgraph

# Docker Compose
docker compose pull  # Pull previous version
docker compose up -d
```

### Delete Release

```bash
# Delete release (keeps tag)
gh release delete v2.5.0

# Delete tag (if needed)
git tag -d v2.5.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v2.5.0
```

### Revert Version Bump

```bash
# Find the version bump commit
git log --oneline | grep "bump deployment versions"

# Revert the commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

## Continuous Deployment

For automated deployments to staging/production:

1. Create environment-specific workflows in `.github/workflows/`
2. Use deployment environments in GitHub
3. Add approval gates for production
4. Integrate with ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps

**Example**: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yaml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to Staging

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          kubectl apply -k deployments/kustomize/overlays/staging
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test releases in staging first**
2. **Use pre-release versions for testing** (beta, rc)
3. **Keep CHANGELOG.md updated** with each release
4. **Tag commits after merging to main**, not on feature branches
5. **Use semantic versioning consistently**
6. **Document breaking changes prominently**
7. **Automate deployment to staging**, manual to production
8. **Monitor after release** (Grafana dashboards)

## Security

- Docker images include SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- Only tagged releases are published to registries
- Use signed commits for release tags (recommended)
