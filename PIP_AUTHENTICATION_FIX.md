# Pip Authentication Fix - 2025-10-20

## Issue

Pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks were failing with pip authentication errors:

```
ERROR: Exception:
...
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
```

The error occurred because pip was trying to authenticate to a private Google Artifact Registry:
```
https://us-central1-python.pkg.dev/aip-artifacts-store/aipy/simple/
```

## Root Cause

The user's pip configuration file contained an `extra-index-url` pointing to a private repository that required authentication.

**Location**: `~/.config/pip/pip.conf`

**Problematic Configuration**:
```ini
[global]
extra-index-url = https://us-central1-python.pkg.dev/aip-artifacts-store/aipy/simple/
```

## Solution

### Step 1: Located the Configuration

```bash
pip config list
# Output: global.extra-index-url='https://us-central1-python.pkg.dev/aip-artifacts-store/aipy/simple/'
```

### Step 2: Removed Private Registry Reference

**File**: `~/.config/pip/pip.conf`

**Before**:
```ini
[global]
extra-index-url = https://us-central1-python.pkg.dev/aip-artifacts-store/aipy/simple/
```

**After**:
```ini
[global]
# Private registries removed - using PyPI only
```

### Step 3: Verified Fix

```bash
pip config list
# Output: (no extra configuration)

# Test pre-commit hooks
git commit -m "test"
# Result: ✅ All hooks passed without authentication errors
```

## Verification

Pre-commit hooks now install successfully from public PyPI without requiring authentication:

- ✅ `https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks` - Installed successfully
- ✅ `https://github.com/psf/black` - Installed successfully
- ✅ `https://github.com/pycqa/isort` - Installed successfully
- ✅ `https://github.com/pycqa/flake8` - Installed successfully
- ✅ `https://github.com/pycqa/bandit` - Installed successfully
- ✅ `https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks` - Installed successfully
- ✅ `https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy` - Installed successfully
- ✅ `https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema` - Installed successfully

All hooks passed successfully without any authentication prompts.

## Impact

**Before**:
- Pre-commit hooks failed during installation
- Pre-push hooks blocked commits
- Required manual `--no-verify` flag to bypass

**After**:
- All hooks install and run successfully
- No authentication required
- Standard git workflow restored

## Recommendations

1. **For Project Users**: Ensure your pip configuration only uses public repositories (PyPI)

2. **Check Your Configuration**:
   ```bash
   pip config list
   ```
   Should show no `extra-index-url` or only public registries.

3. **Location of pip.conf**:
   - Linux/macOS: `~/.config/pip/pip.conf` or `~/.pip/pip.conf`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini`
   - System-wide: `/etc/pip.conf` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\ProgramData\pip\pip.ini` (Windows)

4. **If You Need Private Registries**: Use per-project configuration or environment variables instead of global configuration.
